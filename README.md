Android TV: Stream of channels using azure mobile services and push notifications

We are students of the cauca's university, in colombia. We are using the project "Android TV Live Channel Plugin with user-entered stream files" which can be found in this url "https://github.com/jafv95/EnfasisTV". We are using this project just with academic objetives, exploring new tecnologies like android tv. We are going to improve this aplication to uses  backend in azure mobile services and streaming with vlc. Aditional, we are going to improve the original version adding push notifications. Thanks
